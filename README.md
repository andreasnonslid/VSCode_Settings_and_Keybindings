# VSCode_Settings_and_Keybindings

This repository contains settings and keybinds for VSCode, which I use with a NeoVim extension.
## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to store and manage my settings and keybinds for VSCode so that I can easily set up new environments or recover existing ones.
